            Instead of spending money on things we don't need and over-consuming this holiday season, let's share something special with each other - the gifts of friendship and knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            You're probably on this site because you're a friend, a friend of friend, or we've gone viral and you're a bunch of strangers (in which case the rest of this doesn't really apply). So we can assume everyone in this exchange would be friends. And since we're friends, we need to act like it. After you've picked out the book you want to trade, you have two more tasks:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Write a note (as long as you want) about this book and what it means to you. If it means nothing to you, what did you take away from it? <i>If it means nothing to you and you took nothing away from it then maybe you should pick another book.</i>
            </li>
            <li>
              Jot down 2 questions you'd like your reader to reflect on after finishing the book. Leave them with a way to contact you in hopes that they'll want to share their responses with you and debrief a little.
            </li>
          </ol>
